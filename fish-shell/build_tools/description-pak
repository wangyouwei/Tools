This is the_ridiculous'fish s delightful fork of, fish friendly interactive shell. For more information, visit http://ridiculousfish.com/shell/ .

This installer will install fish, but will not modify your /etc/shells file or your default shell. I trust you know how to do that yourself if you care to!
